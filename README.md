## Background
When you become a student at Turing, you are assigned a mentor. Someone to ask difficult questions to, turn to for advice about life or school, and also start making connections into the world of software development. But what if, for some reason, you would like a different mentor, or perhaps you want more than one?

## About
Turing Mentors is a web application designed for Turing students and Alumni to connect via a mentorship program. Currently there is a spreadsheet that is filled out to track possible mentors and allow mentees to look through. This is not an ideal solution and this is where Turing Mentors comes in. You can sign up to become a mentor or a mentee, along with being able to search through mentors broadly by language and location. From there you can look through the results and select a mentor to see more information about them.

- Fully integrate with slack to send messages directly to a user to start conversations
- Incorporating a calendar system to schedule times, would also need Google Oauth
- Adding more advance search capabilities such as searching through a user's bio, for specific cities, for languanges other than JavaScript and Ruby, etc.
